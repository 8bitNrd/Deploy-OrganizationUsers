# New-ADLab

This Powershell script will deploy an organization that will be composed of a CEO, VPs, Managers and Employees.
The script will also create an Organization unit called UserAccount and place an Organization unit for each department so the employee and manager will live in the department OU. 
CEO and VPs will be placed in the Administration OU.

Make sure you update the variables $domainName and $topLevelDomain to match your domain name and top-level domain.

Hope you enjoy and that it saves you time
